Now comes a match-up for a new generation.  AlphaGo, a program that plays what many consider the most difficult of board games, Go, has just won the first of five matches against the world's top human player. The series is scheduled to continue through March 12. Developed by Google's DeepMind subsidiary, AlphaGo has already beaten the European Go champion. A few days before the latest competition, we asked Risto Miikkulainen, an artificial intelligence researcher at the University of Texas at Austin, for his thoughts on this historic contest. Q: So is this just the next inevitable step up from computers that can beat humans at games like chess? It's very different from playing chess. Those other systems were based on old-fashioned artificial intelligence, where you search all the possible moves to find the best ones. Go was always a huge challenge because it has too big of a search space to evaluate in a reasonable amount of time. There are more possible moves than atoms in the universe. So AlphaGo is completely different. Like humans, it uses pattern recognition. Q: Do I hear a bit of admiration in the way you talk about this advance? It's a huge step forward. Until very recently, we thought mastering Go would be decades away. That Google could do it so soon is remarkable and a bit surprising. Q: What kinds of insights were needed to make such a robust program? Google brought together two ideas in artificial intelligence that have actually been around since the 1990s, called Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and deep learning. MCTS is a way of taking a really big search space and narrowing it down to a manageable search. Instead of playing out every possible scenario from start to finish, it tests a random sample of moves and plays them out to maybe 20 moves in the future. Deep learning is similar to the way a human baby learns. Instead of being pre-programmed with a bunch of rules and facts, the program observed many, many games played by human experts and over time, discovered useful patterns. If I were working on this problem, I would have used similar techniques. Q: Do you think AlphaGo will win the series of 5 matches? Whether it wins or loses now doesn't matter, it will ultimately win. If they lose, they will bring in new techniques to make it better. So whether it's next week or next year, they will eventually beat the best humans. Q: Have you placed bets on the competition? AlphaGo won over the European Go champ resoundingly, but the world champion is much stronger. If the match against the European champ had been close, my money would be on the world champion. But it wasn't. I think the most interesting result would be if the matches are very close. It would force people to think, what is the program doing well and what is missing? I think we would make the most progress that way. If it's a lopsided victory, people might think it's all over and there's no need to keep refining it. Q: Besides playing games, what are some real-world applications of this kind of artificial intelligence software? Really any kind of problem that involves very big search spaces and where a pattern-based approach might work. It could help in medical diagnostics. It could help with scheduling and logistics. It might also have applications in image, speech or face recognition.

If it's a lopsided victory, people might think it's all over and there's no need to keep refining it.</p> <p><strong>Q: Besides playing games, what are some real-world applications of this kind of artificial intelligence software?</strong></p> <p>Really any kind of problem that involves very big search spaces and where a pattern-based approach might work. It could help in medical diagnostics. It could help with scheduling and logistics. It might also have applications in image, speech or face recognition.</p> <p><strong>Learn more about Risto Miikkulainen's research:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://thehook.texasexes.org/artificial-evolution/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video: Artificial Evolution</a>, The Hook</p> <p><a href=\"https://cns.utexas.edu/news/computer-scientists-find-mass-extinctions-can-accelerate-evolution\" rel=\"nofollow\">Computer Scientists Find Mass Extinctions Can Accelerate Evolution</a>, CNS News</p> <p><a href=\"https://cns.utexas.edu/news/game-bots-pass-turing-test\" rel=\"nofollow\">Artificially Intelligent Game Bots Pass the Turing Test on Turing's Centenary</a>, CNS News</p> </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-news-categories field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">News categories: </div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news-categories/faculty\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Faculty</a></div><div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/news-categories/research\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Research</a></div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-news-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above\"><div class=\"field-label\">Tags: </div><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news-tags/artificial-intelligence\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Artificial Intelligence</a></div><div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/news-tags/risto-miikkulainen\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Risto Miikkulainen</a></div></div></div>","title":"A.I.

Dr. Aaronson will be joining as the David J. Bruton Jr. Centennial Professor of Computer Science and will be leading the charge to establish UT’s presence in quantum computing; Dr. Moshkovitz will be joining as an Associate Professor in theoretical computer science. Aaronson and Moshkovitz join UTCS’s already exceptionally strong theory research group, including Anna Gal, Adam Klivans, Greg Plaxton, Eric Price, Vijaya Ramachandran, Brent Waters, and David Zuckerman. Their addition to this group extends an exceptional lineage that began with one of the field’s founding fathers, Edsger Dijkstra, who, among a laundry list of other accomplishments, laid the groundwork for what is now considered theoretical computer science. Dr. Aaronson is one of the leading researchers in the fields of quantum computing and complexity class theory. His popular blog, Shtetl-Optimized, explores a wide variety of subjects in his areas of research (and beyond), including a series of lectures he delivered at MIT entitled “Quantum Computing since Democritus.” Dr. Aaronson notes that Texas has produced some of the most important research—and researchers—in the field of quantum computing. In addition to his professorship, he has also accepted the position of founding director of a new center at UT for quantum computing (proposed motto: “Hook Em Hadamards”). Dr. Moshkovitz will be joining UT Computer Science as an associate professor. She is a noted professor at MIT, winning a teaching award for her course on the design and analysis of algorithms, and, like Dr. Aaronson, completed a postdoc at the prestigious Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton. (The IAS was also home to Albert Einstein, Kurt Godel, and John von Neumann.) Two of her former students went on to win undergraduate research awards at MIT, and she is well-known in the algorithms community for a widely-read paper on the PCP (Probabilistically-Checkable Proofs) algorithm, which gives an important result about randomized algorithms to verify proofs of certain classes of problems. Both Dr. Aaronson and Dr. Moshkovitz will officially join UT Computer Science in the fall of 2016.

So, it must have been kismet that her first motion picture credit for DreamWorks Animation is “Kung Fu Panda 3,” which boasts an all-star cast including Jack Black, Angelina Jolie and Bryan Cranston. It opens in theaters Friday. “How really awesome is it that my first movie is about pandas?” Davalath, who spent most of her childhood and teens in the Alamo City, where her parents still live, said in a phone chat. “My desk at work is covered with them, and practically every gift I’ve gotten has been panda-oriented.” Davalath, 29, a character technical director on the animated feature, was responsible for what she called rigging — “placing joints into stuffed animals or static puppets.” She also programs a control system that allows them to move around, she said, before handing her work to the animators who complete the magic. For “Panda 3,” she worked on the bodies of the village pigs and the small pandas, she said, making sure the elbows and knees were soft and rounded, reflecting lots of baby fat. “So, every time you see tiny pandas walking around, it was me who helped put them there,” she said. Her DreamWorks supervisor Kevin Rogers praised her skills. “We were fortunate to have Megha working on the baby pandas,” he wrote in an email. “Over the life of the show, the use of baby pandas grew, in part because of how cute they were in animation. “This would not have been so without the solid rigs built by her,” Rogers added, “proving that Megha’s contributions to ‘Kung Fu Panda 3’ were invaluable.” She also worked on lots of hair in the movie, she said, giving that movement too. For instance, Davalath was responsible for the long mustache and prominent eyebrows of teacher Shifu, voiced by Dustin Hoffman. Davalath said she wanted to study movie animation since she was a child, even writing a paper about it at Hobby Middle School. Her path, however, took a couple of detours. She attended a high school that had little to do with the arts, Health Careers High, a magnet school in the Northside Independent School District that prepares students for occupations in health care. “I basically wanted to go there to be with my friends,” she said. Her dad, Nataraj Davalath, a longtime software developer at USAA, influenced her choice for college major, she said. “He said he would let me go into art school as long as I got a degree in computer science first. That way, I’d have a good foundation,” she said. That’s what she studied at the University of Texas at Austin. “I took classes in art, so it was the perfect blend of the technical and the creative.” After graduating in 2008, she attended graduate school at Texas A University, where she began specializing. She earned a degree in visualization, which encompassed rigging. A also was the place she made invaluable contacts, as it hosted experts from DreamWorks and other big studios. “It was a really good networking school,” she said. The year of her graduation in 2011, she was hired by DreamWorks. Although “Panda” wasn’t the first movie she worked on, it is the first one to be released. Her next project is “Trolls,” which is due out in late 2016. “I’m part of the hair team,“ she said, “responsible for the look, style and movement of the hair. “We worked on characters voiced by Anna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake and Russell Brand.” Meanwhile, her excited parents will be watching for her name on the big screen. “We already got tickets,” her father said. He’s also happy his guidance helped Megha get the well-rounded education that figured into her success. “I remember when Megha was in high school, she wanted to go into a special effects or animation program right away,” he said. “But I encouraged her to get a basic technical degree before getting into the entertainment industry.” Megha remains grateful to this day that she listened to her dad. “I’ve utilized everything I’ve learned.” Source: San Antonio Express-News News categories: AlumniTags: Megha Davalath","date":"2016-02-17T03:48:28+0000","html":"<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/images/920x920.jpg\" style=\"width:920px\" width=\"920\" height=\"541\" /></p> <p>Movie CGI artist Megha Davalath has been obsessed with pandas since she was a child in San Antonio, collecting everything from stuffed animals to trashcans to wind chimes in celebration of her favorite cuddly creature.</p> <p>So, it must have been kismet that her first motion picture credit for DreamWorks Animation is “Kung Fu Panda 3,” which boasts an all-star cast including Jack Black, Angelina Jolie and Bryan Cranston.

I grew up liking them and still do them with my mom when I go home. We do puzzles every morning.” As an English major at Brown University, Wheeler, 25, took her passion for crossword puzzles to a new level and began creating them. She became the The New York Times’ youngest female crossword constructor at age 19. “Today’s puzzle is a debut,” Jim Horne wrote in a blog about Wheeler’s puzzle. “That’s somewhat unusual. We average a few debuts a month. It’s a debut by a teenager. That’s rare. The teenage constructor is a young woman. That’s unique.” Read the blog atwordplay.blogs.nytimes.com. Last June, she received a surprise call from someone at Superhuman, a new program on Fox, set to premiere Jan. 4 from 8 to 10 p.m. Talent scouts had seen Wheeler’s crosswords in The Times and reached out to see if she would like to compete on the new show. Although she hadn’t originally answered the casting call, she completed the challenges to qualify for the show and flew to Los Angeles in June. She stayed for a week with two days of filming as one of 12 contestants, she said. They met actor Kal Penn, show host, and guest panelists including iconic boxer and entertainer Mike Tyson, actress/comedian Mary Lynn Rajskub and neurosurgeon Dr. Rahul Jandial. Penn and the panelists provided insights and comedic commentary about the competitors’ unique abilities, while guiding the studio audience, who ultimately would decide which mental mastermind should take home the title of Superhuman and the grand prize. The show premiere will test the abilities of the 12 ordinary people to use their extraordinary skills and win the $100,000 prize. Each of the contestants possesses a distinct, nearly superhuman ability in such fields as memory, hearing, taste, touch, smell, and sight, according to Kelsey Jenkins of Beck Media & Marketing in Santa Monica, Calif. They were challenged to push their skills to the limit to determine if they are “Superhuman” enough to win the prize. The other contestants are a mix of men and women, mostly in their 30s and 40s, one of whom is in high school, Wheeler said. They had to meet “a huge range challenges that weren’t all mental and were built around sight, smell, hearing and possessing amazing memories,” she said. The audience could vote for just one person, and the results are secret. So people will have to tune in Jan. 4 to find out who won. “It was stressful at first when I got there,” she said. “I wasn’t sure if I was going to do well, but hanging out with the other contestants relaxed me. It was really interesting to see the inner workings of how TV shows are produced, and I would jump at the chance to do it again.” Wheeler grew up in Easton with siblings Harry, 23, and Grace, 18, and graduated from Joel Barlow High School. Her dad, Ward Wheeler, is curator of the Museum of Natural History in New York. Wheeler earned a bachelor’s degree in English at Brown and then moved to Madison, Wis., where she worked for three years. Now a graduate student in computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, her goal is to become a software engineer. Life’s a game, and she’s having a ton of fun playing it. Tune in: The all-new, two-hour special Superhuman airs Monday, Jan. 4, from 8 to 10 p.m. on FOX.
