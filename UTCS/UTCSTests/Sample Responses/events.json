While we have seen tremendous progress in recent years on naming-style tasks like image classification or  object detection, a meaningful understanding requires going beyond this paradigm.  Scenes are inherently 3D, so our understanding must also capture the underlying 3D and physical properties. Additionally, our understanding must be human-centric since any man-made scene has been built with humans in mind. Despite the importance of obtaining a 3D and human-centric understanding, we are only beginning to scratch the surface on both fronts: many fundamental questions, in terms of how to both frame and solve the problem, remain unanswered. \nIn this talk, I will discuss my efforts towards building a physical and human-centric understanding of images. I will present work addressing the questions: (1) what 3D properties should we model and predict from images, and do we actually need explicit 3D training data to do this? (2) how can we reconcile data-driven learning techniques with the physical constraints that exist in the world? and (3) how can understanding humans improve traditional 3D and object recognition tasks?\nSpeaker Bio: David Fouhey is a Ph.D. student at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon  University, where he is advised by Abhinav Gupta and Martial Hebert.

Computational models for such behavioral predictions can be learned via a wearable first-person camera that taps into our visual sensation directly by “putting yourself in her/his shoes”. \nIn this talk, I will discuss what the wearable cameras tell us about our personal and social behaviors.First, the wearable camera tells us about my behaviors. The first person video reveals not only our 3D geometric motion, but more importantly all the nuances of our physical sensations. Our model integrates visual scene semantics, 3D reconstruction, and inverse optimal control to compute precisely the force applied (input force) and experienced (gravity, air drag, and friction) in a first person sport video. Second, wearable camera tells us about our social behaviors, in particular, engaging joint attention. I will present 3D localization of joint attention, learning its geometric configuration, and applications to sport analytics, behavioral assessment, and automatic video editing of social footage. Lastly, a wearable camera records how other people behave, e.g., an exchange of social signals. I will show 3D modeling of human body motion or deformable objects at unprecedented spatial resolution, which can be further used to recognize the spatiotemporal relationship between motions. \nTogether these results will enable a computational system that can effect novel means to understand and help people.\nSpeaker Bio: Hyun Soo Park is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Computer and Information Science at University of Pennsylvania working with Prof. Jianbo Shi.

The largest of these are expected to connect hundreds of thousands of servers and are expected to do so with high reliability and low cost. The current solution to these problems is to use an idea first proposed for telephone networks in the early 1950's: Clos network topologies. These topologies have a number of substantial benefits, but their use in this new domain raises a set of questions. \nIn this talk, I will present two systems that make small changes to state-of-the-art data center designs to provide large improvements to performance, reliability, and cost. I will first describe F10, a data center architecture that can provide both near-instantaneous reaction to failures and near-optimal handling of long-term load balancing. Central to this architecture is a novel network topology that provides all of the benefits of a traditional Clos topology, but also admits local reaction to and recovery from failures. I will also describe Subways, a network architecture that looks at how to use multiple network interfaces on each server to handle growth and performance issues in today's data centers. \nSpeaker Bio: Vincent Liu is a PhD candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington.

Such technology would be immensely powerful, be it for aiding a visually-impaired user navigate a world built by the sighted, assisting an analyst in extracting relevant information from a surveillance feed, educating a child playing a game on a touch screen, providing information to a spectator at an art gallery, or interacting with a robot. As computer vision and natural language processing techniques are maturing, we are closer to achieving this dream than we have ever been.\nIn this talk, I will present two ongoing thrusts in my lab that push the boundaries of AI capabilities at the intersection of vision, language, and commonsense reasoning.\nVisual Question Answering (VQA): I will describe the task, our dataset (the largest and most complex of its kind), and our model for free-form and open-ended Visual Question Answering (VQA). Given an image and a natural language question about the image (e.g., “What kind of store is this?”, “How many people are waiting in the queue?”, “Is it safe to cross the street?”), the machine’s task is to automatically produce an accurate natural language answer (“bakery”, “5”, “Yes”). We have collected and recently released a dataset containing >250,000 images, >760,000 questions, and ~10 million answers. Our dataset is enabling the next generation of AI systems, often based on deep learning techniques, for understanding images and language, and performing complex reasoning in our lab and the community at large.\nLearning Common Sense Through Visual Abstraction: Common sense is a key ingredient in building intelligent machines that make \"human-like\" decisions when performing tasks -- be it automatically answering natural language questions, or understanding images and videos. How can machines learn this common sense? While some of this knowledge is explicitly stated in human-generated text (books, articles, blogs, etc.), much of this knowledge is unwritten. While unwritten, it is not unseen! The visual world around us is full of structure bound by commonsense laws. But machines today cannot learn common sense directly by observing our visual world because they cannot accurately perform detailed visual recognition in images and videos. This leads to a chicken-and-egg problem: we would like to learn common sense to allow machines to understand images accurately, but in order to learn common sense, we need accurate image parsing. We argue that the solution is to give up on photorealism. We propose to leverage abstract scenes -- cartoon scenes made from clip art by crowd sourced humans -- to teach our machines common sense.\nSpeaker Bio: Devi Parikh is an Assistant Professor in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech (VT), and an Allen Distinguished Investigator of Artificial Intelligence. She leads the Computer Vision Lab at VT, and is also a member of the Virginia Center for Autonomous Systems (VaCAS) and the VT Discovery Analytics Center (DAC).\nPrior to this, she was a Research Assistant Professor at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC), an academic computer science institute affiliated with University of Chicago.

She received her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Carnegie Mellon University in 2007 and 2009 respectively. She received her B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Rowan University in 2005.\nHer research interests include computer vision, pattern recognition, and AI in general, and visual recognition problems in particular.

They make guesses. Modern machine perception algorithms (for object detection, pose estimation, or image captioning), despite dealing with tremendous amounts of ambiguity, typically do not. \nI will describe a line of work in my lab where we have been developing machine perception and intelligent systems that convey their beliefs about the world by producing a small set of diverse plausible hypotheses or guesses about the state of the world (e.g. multiple segmentations for objects in an image or human body keypoint locations or captions of an image). I will discuss inference in structured and neural models, connections to submodular maximization over a \"doubly-exponential” space, and show results on problems such as semantic segmentation, pose estimation, and prepositional phrase attachment resolution in image captions. \nWe view this line of work as a step towards making modern intelligent systems transparent, by answering the question —  “What does this model believe?”. I will also discuss further steps in this direction such as answering the more difficult question — “Why does this model believe what it does?” — on applications such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Sequential VQA (or a visual Turing test). \nSpeaker Bio: Dhruv Batra is an Assistant Professor at the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech (VT), where he leads the VT Machine Learning & Perception group. He is a member of the Virginia Center for Autonomous Systems (VaCAS) and the VT Discovery Analytics Center (DAC). \nPrior to joining VT, he was a Research Assistant Professor at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC), a philanthropically endowed academic computer science institute located on the University of Chicago campus. He received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Carnegie Mellon University in 2007 and 2010 respectively, advised by Prof. Tsuhan Chen. In past, he has held visiting positions at the Machine Learning Department at CMU, CSAIL MIT, Microsoft Research, and Cornell University. \nHis research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and AI, with a focus on developing intelligent systems that are able to concisely summarize their beliefs about the world, integrate information and beliefs across different sub-components or `modules' of AI (vision, language, reasoning) to extract a holistic view of the world, and explain why they believe what they believe. In past, he has also worked on topics such as interactive co-segmentation of large image collections, human body pose estimation, action recognition, depth estimation, and distributed optimization for inference and learning in probabilistic graphical models.  \nProf. Batra has published more than 50 scientific articles in top-tier journals and conferences, including CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NIPS, ICML, UAI, IJCV, etc. Research from his lab has been featured in Bloomberg Business, The Boston Globe, MIT Technology Review, Newsweek, and a number of popular press magazines and newspapers.

Our work tackles these interactions directly using joint modeling.  This type of model structure allows us to combine component models for each analysis subtask and pass information between them, both reconciling and reinforcing the components' predictions.  Joint models can also capture the dual discrete and continuous nature of language, specifically by integrating neural networks, which process continuous signals, with discrete structured models.  We describe state-of-the-art systems for a range of established NLP tasks, including syntactic parsing, entity resolution, and document summarization.\nSpeaker Bio: Greg is a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley working on natural language processing with Dan Klein.  He is interested in building structured machine learning models for a wide variety of language understanding problems and downstream NLP applications.

The ability to evaluate a new policy from historical data is important for applications where the deployment of a bad policy can be dangerous or costly. After presenting the Doubly Robust estimator recently proposed by Nan Jiang and Lihong Li, I will explore methods for further improving its accuracy, culminating with the \"MAGIC\" estimator, which I recently proposed in collaboration with Emma Brunskill. Intuitively, the MAGIC estimator leverages a new way for combining model-based and model-free estimates, which is based on the idea of complex returns, like the lambda-return. Empirical results suggest that the MAGIC estimator usually performs at least as well as the best previously existing algorithm, and often orders of magnitude better (in terms of mean squared error).\nSpeaker Bio: Philip Thomas is interested in artificial intelligence research, primarily reinforcement learning research. His past work has focused on predicting the performance of new solutions (policies) from historical data, natural gradient methods and their application to policy search, and trying to improve the biological plausibility of policy gradient algorithms by estimating gradients without the need for backpropagation.\nPhilip received his B.S. and M.S. in computer science from Case Western Reserve University in 2008 and 2009 respectively, where Michael Branicky was his adviser.

Through the deployment of middleboxes, enterprise networks today provide improved security -- e.g., filtering malicious content -- and performance capabilities -- e.g., caching frequently accessed content. Although middleboxes are deployed widely in enterprises, they bring with them many challenges: they are complicated to manage, expensive, prone to failures, and challenge privacy expectations.\nIn this talk, we aim to bring the benefits of cloud computing to networking. We argue that middlebox services can be outsourced to cloud providers in a similar fashion to how mail, compute, and storage are today outsourced. We begin by presenting APLOMB, a system that allows enterprises to outsource middlebox processing to a third party cloud or ISP. For enterprise networks, APLOMB can reduce costs, ease management, and provide resources for scalability and failover. For service providers, APLOMB offers new customers and business opportunities, but also presents new challenges. Middleboxes have tighter performance demands than existing cloud services, and hence supporting APLOMB requires redesigning software at the cloud. We re-consider classical cloud challenges including fault-tolerance and privacy, showing how to implement middlebox software solutions with throughput and latency 2-4 orders of magnitude more efficient than general-purpose cloud approaches. Some of the technologies discussed in this talk are presently being adopted by industrial systems used by cloud providers and ISPs.\nSpeaker Bio: Justine Sherry is a computer scientist and doctoral candidate at UC Berkeley. Her interests are in computer networking her work includes middleboxes, networked systems, measurement, cloud computing, and congestion control. Justine's dissertation focuses on new opportunities and challenges arising from the deployment of middleboxes -- such as firewalls and proxies -- as services offered by clouds and ISPs. Justine received her MS from UC Berkeley in 2012, and her BS and BA from the University of Washington in 2010.

State of the art knowledge graphs have accumulated large amounts of beliefs about real world entities using machine reading methods.  Current machine readers have been successful at populating such knowledge graphs by means of pattern detection — a shallow way of machine reading which leverages the redundancy of large corpora to capture language patterns. However, machine readers still lack the ability to fully understand  language. In the pursuit of the much harder goal of language comprehension, knowledge graphs present an opportunity for a virtuous circle:  the accumulated knowledge can be used to improve machine readers in turn, advanced reading methods can be used to populate knowledge graphs with beliefs expressed using complex and potentially ambiguous language. In this talk, I  will elaborate on this virtuous circle, starting with building knowledge graphs, followed by results on using them  for machine reading.\nSpeaker Bio: Ndapa Nakashole is a post-doctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon University.

I will present examples of both. I’ll begin by introducing empirical methods that I created to bring quantitative rigor to the question of how users choose authentication secrets (PINs, passwords, and security questions), a topic that has long been misunderstood due to a lack of data. I will then present two theoretically-grounded approaches that apply cryptography to provide transparency that trusted authorities are behaving correctly. The first addresses servers for distributing public keys for secure communication, ensuring that the authority cannot lie without being detected.  The second ensures that banks that store bitcoins are solvent: that they actually are holding as many bitcoins as they have promised to their clients.\nSpeaker Bio: Joseph Bonneau is a Postdoctoral Researcher at Stanford University and a Technology Fellow at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. His research focuses on cryptography and security protocols, particularly how they interact with human and organizational behavior and economic incentives.
