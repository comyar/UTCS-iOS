While we have seen tremendous progress in recent years on naming-style tasks like image classification or\u00a0 object detection, a meaningful understanding requires going beyond this paradigm.\u00a0 Scenes are inherently 3D, so our understanding must also capture the underlying 3D and physical properties. Additionally, our understanding must be human-centric since any man-made scene has been built with humans in mind. Despite the importance of obtaining a 3D and human-centric understanding, we are only beginning to scratch the surface on both fronts: many fundamental questions, in terms of how to both frame and solve the problem, remain unanswered.\u00a0\nIn this talk, I will discuss my efforts towards building a physical and human-centric understanding of images. I will present work addressing the questions: (1) what 3D properties should we model and predict from images, and do we actually need explicit 3D training data to do this? (2) how can we reconcile data-driven learning techniques with the physical constraints that exist in the world? and (3) how can understanding humans improve traditional 3D and object recognition tasks?\nSpeaker Bio: David Fouhey is a Ph.D. student at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon\u00a0 University, where he is advised by Abhinav Gupta and Martial Hebert.

Computational models for such behavioral predictions can be learned via a wearable first-person camera that taps into our visual sensation directly by \u201cputting yourself in her/his shoes\u201d. \nIn this talk, I will discuss what the wearable cameras tell us about our personal and social behaviors.First, the wearable camera tells us about my behaviors. The first person video reveals not only our 3D geometric motion, but more importantly all the nuances of our physical sensations. Our model integrates visual scene semantics, 3D reconstruction, and inverse optimal control to compute precisely the force applied (input force) and experienced (gravity, air drag, and friction) in a first person sport video. Second, wearable camera tells us about our social behaviors, in particular, engaging joint attention. I will present 3D localization of joint attention, learning its geometric configuration, and applications to sport analytics, behavioral assessment, and automatic video editing of social footage. Lastly, a wearable camera records how other people behave, e.g., an exchange of social signals. I will show 3D modeling of human body motion or deformable objects at unprecedented spatial resolution, which can be further used to recognize the spatiotemporal relationship between motions. \nTogether these results will enable a computational system that can effect novel means to understand and help people.\nSpeaker Bio: Hyun Soo Park is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Computer and Information Science at University of Pennsylvania working with Prof. Jianbo Shi.

My research addresses the two fundamental requirements for robust language understanding: leveraging external world knowledge that is missing in standard NLP training datasets, and formulating machine learning methods that extract the precise disambiguation cues lying latent in this noisy, multimodal data. We develop structured and neural models that learn such world knowledge semantics via unlabeled Web-scale features, weakly supervised language embeddings, and cross-modal cues from vision and speech. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on various core NLP tasks and multimodal applications in vision and robotics.\nSpeaker Bio: Mohit Bansal is a research assistant professor (3-year endowed position) at TTI-Chicago.

The largest of these are expected to connect hundreds of thousands of servers and are expected to do so with high reliability and low cost. The current solution to these problems is to use an idea first proposed for telephone networks in the early 1950's: Clos network topologies. These topologies have a number of substantial benefits, but their use in this new domain raises a set of questions. \nIn this talk, I will present two systems that make small changes to state-of-the-art data center designs to provide large improvements to performance, reliability, and cost. I will first describe F10, a data center architecture that can provide both near-instantaneous reaction to failures and near-optimal handling of long-term load balancing. Central to this architecture is a novel network topology that provides all of the benefits of a traditional Clos topology, but also admits local reaction to and recovery from failures. I will also describe Subways, a network architecture that looks at how to use multiple network interfaces on each server to handle growth and performance issues in today's data centers. \nSpeaker Bio: Vincent Liu is a PhD candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington.
