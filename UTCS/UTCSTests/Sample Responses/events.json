They make guesses. Modern machine perception algorithms (for object detection, pose estimation, or image captioning), despite dealing with tremendous amounts of ambiguity, typically do not. \nI will describe a line of work in my lab where we have been developing machine perception and intelligent systems that convey their beliefs about the world by producing a small set of diverse plausible hypotheses or guesses about the state of the world (e.g. multiple segmentations for objects in an image or human body keypoint locations or captions of an image). I will discuss inference in structured and neural models, connections to submodular maximization over a \"doubly-exponential” space, and show results on problems such as semantic segmentation, pose estimation, and prepositional phrase attachment resolution in image captions. \nWe view this line of work as a step towards making modern intelligent systems transparent, by answering the question —  “What does this model believe?”. I will also discuss further steps in this direction such as answering the more difficult question — “Why does this model believe what it does?” — on applications such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Sequential VQA (or a visual Turing test). \nSpeaker Bio: Dhruv Batra is an Assistant Professor at the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech (VT), where he leads the VT Machine Learning & Perception group. He is a member of the Virginia Center for Autonomous Systems (VaCAS) and the VT Discovery Analytics Center (DAC). \nPrior to joining VT, he was a Research Assistant Professor at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC), a philanthropically endowed academic computer science institute located on the University of Chicago campus. He received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Carnegie Mellon University in 2007 and 2010 respectively, advised by Prof. Tsuhan Chen. In past, he has held visiting positions at the Machine Learning Department at CMU, CSAIL MIT, Microsoft Research, and Cornell University. \nHis research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and AI, with a focus on developing intelligent systems that are able to concisely summarize their beliefs about the world, integrate information and beliefs across different sub-components or `modules' of AI (vision, language, reasoning) to extract a holistic view of the world, and explain why they believe what they believe. In past, he has also worked on topics such as interactive co-segmentation of large image collections, human body pose estimation, action recognition, depth estimation, and distributed optimization for inference and learning in probabilistic graphical models.  \nProf. Batra has published more than 50 scientific articles in top-tier journals and conferences, including CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NIPS, ICML, UAI, IJCV, etc. Research from his lab has been featured in Bloomberg Business, The Boston Globe, MIT Technology Review, Newsweek, and a number of popular press magazines and newspapers.

This talk introduces higher order and multidimensional prefix sums. Moreover, it describes and evaluates SAM, a GPU-friendly algorithm for computing prefix sums and other scans that supports higher orders and multiple dimensions. SAM is communication efficient in the sense that it minimizes main memory accesses. We implemented it in CUDA using a single templated kernel. When computing prefix sums of between a thousand and a billion 32 or 64-bit values, SAM outperforms Thrust, CUDPP, and MGPU on both a Titan X and a K40 GPU. In many cases, it also outperforms CUB, which is partially written in assembly.\nSpeaker Bio: Sepideh Maleki is a master’s student at Texas State University in Computer Science.

In this talk, I will describe two extremes, at the opposite end of the spectrum.  On one end, we study deep neural networks where we learn hierarchical representations through layered networks. On the other end, we study kernel methods, which can be seen as shallow but wide networks.   While theoretically appealing, kernel methods are empirically challenging and have been lackluster since the arrival of deep learning architectures. In contrast, deep architectures are empirically very successful, although theoretical understanding about those them has been lacking.\nI will describe our efforts and findings in investigating these two paradigms for real-world applications such as automatic speech recognition. Specifically,  our extensive empirical studies, enabled by large-scale computing, highlight the similarity and difference between them. In particular, they suggest that being shallow and random in learning representation is almost equally powerful.\nI will conclude by relating this line of work to other works in our lab and other research groups, and reflect on possible directions for future research.\nSpeaker Bio:  Dr. Fei Sha is an associate professor and Samueli Fellow  at UCLA's Computer Science Department.

Our work tackles these interactions directly using joint modeling.  This type of model structure allows us to combine component models for each analysis subtask and pass information between them, both reconciling and reinforcing the components' predictions.  Joint models can also capture the dual discrete and continuous nature of language, specifically by integrating neural networks, which process continuous signals, with discrete structured models.  We describe state-of-the-art systems for a range of established NLP tasks, including syntactic parsing, entity resolution, and document summarization.\nSpeaker Bio: Greg is a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley working on natural language processing with Dan Klein.

The ability to evaluate a new policy from historical data is important for applications where the deployment of a bad policy can be dangerous or costly. After presenting the Doubly Robust estimator recently proposed by Nan Jiang and Lihong Li, I will explore methods for further improving its accuracy, culminating with the \"MAGIC\" estimator, which I recently proposed in collaboration with Emma Brunskill. Intuitively, the MAGIC estimator leverages a new way for combining model-based and model-free estimates, which is based on the idea of complex returns, like the lambda-return. Empirical results suggest that the MAGIC estimator usually performs at least as well as the best previously existing algorithm, and often orders of magnitude better (in terms of mean squared error).\nSpeaker Bio: Philip Thomas is interested in artificial intelligence research, primarily reinforcement learning research.

Through the deployment of middleboxes, enterprise networks today provide improved security -- e.g., filtering malicious content -- and performance capabilities -- e.g., caching frequently accessed content. Although middleboxes are deployed widely in enterprises, they bring with them many challenges: they are complicated to manage, expensive, prone to failures, and challenge privacy expectations.\nIn this talk, we aim to bring the benefits of cloud computing to networking. We argue that middlebox services can be outsourced to cloud providers in a similar fashion to how mail, compute, and storage are today outsourced. We begin by presenting APLOMB, a system that allows enterprises to outsource middlebox processing to a third party cloud or ISP. For enterprise networks, APLOMB can reduce costs, ease management, and provide resources for scalability and failover. For service providers, APLOMB offers new customers and business opportunities, but also presents new challenges. Middleboxes have tighter performance demands than existing cloud services, and hence supporting APLOMB requires redesigning software at the cloud. We re-consider classical cloud challenges including fault-tolerance and privacy, showing how to implement middlebox software solutions with throughput and latency 2-4 orders of magnitude more efficient than general-purpose cloud approaches. Some of the technologies discussed in this talk are presently being adopted by industrial systems used by cloud providers and ISPs.\nSpeaker Bio: Justine Sherry is a computer scientist and doctoral candidate at UC Berkeley. Her interests are in computer networking her work includes middleboxes, networked systems, measurement, cloud computing, and congestion control. Justine's dissertation focuses on new opportunities and challenges arising from the deployment of middleboxes -- such as firewalls and proxies -- as services offered by clouds and ISPs. Justine received her MS from UC Berkeley in 2012, and her BS and BA from the University of Washington in 2010.

State of the art knowledge graphs have accumulated large amounts of beliefs about real world entities using machine reading methods.  Current machine readers have been successful at populating such knowledge graphs by means of pattern detection — a shallow way of machine reading which leverages the redundancy of large corpora to capture language patterns. However, machine readers still lack the ability to fully understand  language. In the pursuit of the much harder goal of language comprehension, knowledge graphs present an opportunity for a virtuous circle:  the accumulated knowledge can be used to improve machine readers in turn, advanced reading methods can be used to populate knowledge graphs with beliefs expressed using complex and potentially ambiguous language. In this talk, I  will elaborate on this virtuous circle, starting with building knowledge graphs, followed by results on using them  for machine reading.\nSpeaker Bio: Ndapa Nakashole is a post-doctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon University.

The recent successes typically rely on a large amount of supervision (e.g., class labels). While many deep learning algorithms focus on a discriminative task and extract only task-relevant features that are invariant to other factors, complex sensory data is often generated from intricate interaction between underlying factors of variations (for example, pose, morphology and viewpoints for 3d object images). In this work, we tackle the problem of learning deep representations that disentangle underlying factors of variation and allow for complex reasoning and inference that involve multiple factors. Specifically, we develop deep generative models with higher-order interactions among groups of hidden units, where each group learns to encode a distinct factor of variation. We present several successful instances of deep architectures and their learning methods, including supervised and weakly-supervised setting. Our models achieve strong performance in emotion recognition, face verification, data-driven modeling of 3d objects, and video game prediction. I will also present other related ongoing work.\nSpeaker Bio: Honglak Lee is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

I will present examples of both. I’ll begin by introducing empirical methods that I created to bring quantitative rigor to the question of how users choose authentication secrets (PINs, passwords, and security questions), a topic that has long been misunderstood due to a lack of data. I will then present two theoretically-grounded approaches that apply cryptography to provide transparency that trusted authorities are behaving correctly. The first addresses servers for distributing public keys for secure communication, ensuring that the authority cannot lie without being detected.  The second ensures that banks that store bitcoins are solvent: that they actually are holding as many bitcoins as they have promised to their clients.\nSpeaker Bio: Joseph Bonneau is a Postdoctoral Researcher at Stanford University and a Technology Fellow at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
